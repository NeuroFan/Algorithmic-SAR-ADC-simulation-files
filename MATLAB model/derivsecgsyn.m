% ODE file for generating the synthetic ECG
% This file provides dxdt = F(t,x) taking input paramters: 
% rr: rr process 
% sfint: Internal sampling frequency [Hertz]
% Order of extrema: [P Q R S T]
% ti = angles of extrema [radians] 
% ai = z-position of extrema 
% bi = Gaussian width of peaks
