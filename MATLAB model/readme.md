MATLAB models include our tracking ADC and a few similiar works that are mentioned in the paper. 

The scripts report number of bit cycles for conversion of differnt types of signals using different SAR algorithms.

Our implementation is **"Arithmetic_Tracking_WorkingVersion.m"**. Uncomments instructions in line 70 to 75 (and associated instructions above it) to simulate for different signal types. Run **"sar_adc.m"** for simulation of regular SAR ADC simulation, **"M_Bit_Fixed_With_1th_Order_Predication.m"** is another conventional tracking.
